        <!-- <p>Through out my life (so far), I have moved around a lot. I was born in Hamburg, Germany, lived through my early childhood in Shanghai, China, Immigrated to Vancouver, Canada, now I reside in New York, United States in pursue of my
          bachelors
          degree at NYU. Having moved all over the world, my passion for technology initially grew out necessity - it is my only way of communicating with my friends around the world.</p> -->
        <p>My first real programing experience was through a computer science class in 10th grade. The very first programing language I learned was Scratch (The cat programing language). I was fascinated by how easy it was to make the cat move across
          my screen with for loops and while loops. From these high school classes, I have developed a passion for computer science.</p>
        <p>This summer I had the pleasure of interning at Deloitte on the Cloud Solution Architecture team. From the main three pillars, I worked on drafting the first copy of a cloud cost optimization reference architecture, onboarding clients to
          cloud platforms as well as monitoring and optimizing the onboarding process. I look forward to continue my internship throughout the fall school semester.

        <p>Sophomore year I worked at Ideanomics which is a publicly traded fin-tech company focusing on blockchain and machine learning. As one of the first few employee in the North America headquarter, I had the opportunity to code company's
          website, draft white papers, work on custom Ethereum algorithm, and consult on key projects.</p>
        <p>I also worked at NYU's Bobst Library as a Desktop Support Specialist. Ranging from technical questions such as program troubleshooting or software version control
          to non-technical questions like printer help, I addressed any difficulties clients have. I frequently helped clients identity their questions or concerns and provide accurate solution.</p>
        <p>Looking forward, I am eager to continue my journey in the computer science world. I want to continue learning new technology as I progress through different projects. Having tried a few different areas in this field, my experience further
          strengthened my belief that technology can make a positive impact on everyone therefore I set out to help as many as I can.</p>
