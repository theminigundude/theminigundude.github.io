            A firm belief that technology has the power to change people's lives through development, integration, application and education.

        <p>Through out my life (so far), I have moved around a lot. I was born in Hamburg, Germany, lived through my early childhood in Shanghai, China, Immigrated to Vancouver, Canada, now I reside in New York, United States in pursue of my
          bachelors
          degree at NYU. Having moved all over the world, my passion for technology initially grew out necessity - it is my only way of communicating with my friends around the world.</p>
        <p>My first real programing experience was though a computer science class in 10th grade. The very first programing language I learned was Scratch (The cat programing language). I was fascinated by how easy it is to make the cat move across
          my screen with for loops and while loops. From these high school classes, I have developed a passion especially for front-end programing.</p>

      <div class="six columns">
        <p>Currently I work at Ideanomics which is a publicly traded financial technology company focusing on blockchain and machine learning. As one of the first few employee in the North America headquarter, I had the opportunity to code company's
          website, draft white papers, work on custom Ethereum algorithm, and consult on key projects.</p>
        <p>I am also working at New York University's Bobst Library as a Desktop Support Specialist. We assists NYU community's computer related problems. Ranging from technical questions such as program troubleshooting or software version control
          to non-technical questions like printer help, I address any difficulties clients have I frequently help clients identity their questions or concerns and provide accurate solution.</p>
        <p>Looking forward, I am eager to continue my journey in the computer science world. I want to continue learning new technology even after I graduate from university. Having tried a few different areas in this field, my experience further
          strengthened my belief that technology can make a positive impact on everyone therefore I set out to help as many as I can.</p>
